            <p>
              On the eve of the publication of
              <em>The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes</em>, author Suzanne
              Collins spoke to David Levithan, her publisher and one of her
              editors, about the making of the book.
            </p>

            <p>
              <span>David Levithan:</span> One of the first things you said to
              me about this book was that I'd better brush up on my Hobbes,
              Locke, and Rousseau to best understand what you were doing with
              it. That feels like a great springboard for this conversation...
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>Suzanne Collins:</span> This novel began in a philosophical
              swamp that my brain swam around in until the narrative came to
              me...
            </p>

            <p>
              <span>David Levithan:</span> Another influence on the book is
              Wordsworth, whose "Lucy Gray" influences both your character of
              that name and one of the ballads she sings...
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>Suzanne Collins:</span> Romanticism emerged in the late 18th
              century and celebrates individualism, emotion, nature, free
              expression, and the form of nationalism embodied by the Covey...
            </p>

            <p>
              <span>David Levithan:</span> What was it like to rewind the world
              you'd built by sixty-four years? What were some of the touchstones
              you used to understand what this version of Panem would be?
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>Suzanne Collins:</span> I really enjoyed going back in time
              to an earlier version of Panem and visiting the reconstruction
              period that followed the Dark Days...
            </p>

            <p>
              <span>David Levithan:</span> What about the early Hunger Games?
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>Suzanne Collins:</span> Even as the victor in the war, the
              Capitol wouldn't have had the time or resources for anything
              elaborate...
            </p>

            <p>
              <span>David Levithan:</span> What was it like to have to dial back
              a character you created in his late maturity and then to rethink
              him as an eighteen-year-old?
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>Suzanne Collins:</span> Well, I'm back to Wordsworth, who
              wrote, "The child is the father of the man." The groundwork for
              the aging President Snow of the trilogy was laid in childhood...
            </p>

            <p>
              <span>David Levithan:</span> I'll confess it was hard for me to
              get Donald Sutherland out of my head (because he's a masterful
              Snow). How is he different from how you pictured Snow in the
              books?
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>Suzanne Collins:</span> I agree, he is a masterful Snow!
              He's such a talented actor; I could watch him in anything,
              really...
            </p>

            <p>
              <span>David Levithan:</span> One of the things that struck me the
              most when I read the opening of <em>Ballad</em> for the first time
              was your decision to shift from first person to close third
              person...
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>Suzanne Collins:</span> The first series I did,
              <em>The Underland Chronicles</em>, was in close third person...
            </p>

            <p>
              <span>David Levithan:</span> Because the trilogy books were
              written in such quick succession, you didn't really have to deal
              with the feedback loop that a lot of series writers face...
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>Suzanne Collins:</span> I've read some things over the
              years. I'm grateful there's a conversation, but I can't spend too
              much time there...
            </p>

            <p>
              <span>David Levithan:</span> I know where Coriolanus's name came
              from. I know where Lucy Gray's name came from. But what about
              Sejanus Plinth's name?
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>Suzanne Collins:</span> Sejanus is named for a famous Roman,
              Lucius Aelius Sejanus...
            </p>

            <p>
              <span>David Levithan:</span> Were all the linkages to the trilogy
              preplanned or did some characters pop up as you were writing?
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>Suzanne Collins:</span> Given the passage of time between
              <em>Ballad</em> and the trilogy, only a handful of characters make
              an appearance in both...
            </p>

            <p>
              <span>David Levithan:</span> Of all the authors I work with, you
              are one of the firmest believers in structure...
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>Suzanne Collins:</span> The first eight novels I did were
              three parts, nine chapters each...
            </p>

            <p>
              <span>David Levithan:</span> When you're mapping out the story
              before you write it, do you do it chapter by chapter, story beat
              by story beat, in terms of character beats, or some other way?
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>Suzanne Collins:</span> At this point, I decide on the
              dramatic questions of the story for the outer, the inner, and the
              emotional journeys of the protagonist...
            </p>

            <p>
              <span>David Levithan:</span> I know, down to the very title of
              <em>The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes</em>, that music was a huge
              influence when it came to writing this book...
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>Suzanne Collins:</span> A ballad is a song or poem that
              tells a story...
            </p>

            <p>
              <span>David Levithan:</span> There are a number of original songs
              within the book, as well as adaptations and variations of some
              centuries-old poems and ballads...
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>Suzanne Collins:</span> Ballads are often kept alive by an
              oral tradition, passed down from generation to generation, and I
              wanted the Covey to be caretakers of that tradition...
            </p>

            <p>
              <span>David Levithan:</span> Can you tell me about "The Ballad of
              Lucy Gray Baird"? The lyrics are original, but I know you were
              inspired by another traditional piece...
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>Suzanne Collins:</span> Yes, one that has roots in a ballad
              from the 1700s called "The Unfortunate Rake..."
            </p>

            <p>
              <span>David Levithan:</span> "The Hanging Tree" provides one of
              the most interesting through lines between this book and the
              trilogy...
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>Suzanne Collins:</span> It was great to have an opportunity
              to tell the origin story, which wasn't possible in the trilogy,
              and to bridge the two time periods...
            </p>

            <p>
              <span>David Levithan:</span> And there's one other song from the
              trilogy...
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>Suzanne Collins:</span> "Deep in the Meadow," which is the
              lullaby Katniss sings to Rue as she dies in
              <em>The Hunger Games</em>...
            </p>

            <p>
              <span>David Levithan:</span> Can you talk about your writing
              process for the songs?
            </p>
            <p><span>Suzanne Collins:</span> Songs have their own lives...</p>

            <p>
              <span>David Levithan:</span> Do the lyrics come first, and then
              you find the tune? Or do you get a tune in your head and shape the
              words around it?
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>Suzanne Collins:</span> It begins with a key phrase or a
              couple of lines...
            </p>

            <p>
              <span>David Levithan:</span> Do you actually write out the music,
              or is it the kind of situation where you could sing the songs but
              need people with more musical training to actually compose them in
              a proper score?
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>Suzanne Collins:</span> I know just enough music to jot down
              a melody line, but I would need composers for arrangements and
              scores...
            </p>

            <p>
              <span>David Levithan:</span> One of the crucial differences
              between Lucy Gray and Katniss is that while Katniss is a reluctant
              performer, Lucy Gray knows her way around a stage...
            </p>
            <p><span>Suzanne Collins:</span> Essential...</p>

            <p>
              <span>David Levithan:</span> Do you listen to music as you write,
              or do you need silence?
            </p>
            <p><span>Suzanne Collins:</span> Silence...</p>
