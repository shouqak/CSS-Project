              At the completion of <em>The Underland Chronicles</em>, Jen Rees
              at Scholastic Press discussed the series with Suzanne Collins.
            </p>

            <p>
              <span>Jen Rees:</span> Of all the places Gregor could have
              traveled to, why the Underland?
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>Suzanne Collins:</span> I liked the fact that this world was
              teeming under New York City and nobody was aware of it...
            </p>

            <p>
              <span>Jen Rees:</span> Is there anything you find/found difficult
              or challenging in writing from the perspective of an 11-year-old
              boy?
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>Suzanne Collins:</span> I remember being eleven very clearly
              and I had a lot of friends who were boys so it felt pretty natural
              being in Gregor's head.
            </p>

            <p><span>Jen Rees:</span> Are you anything like Gregor?</p>
            <p>
              <span>Suzanne Collins:</span> I think I'm like Gregor because we
              both want to do the right thing but sometimes have trouble
              figuring out what it is...
            </p>

            <p>
              <span>Jen Rees:</span> What kinds of things did you enjoy doing
              when you were 11?
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>Suzanne Collins:</span> Gymnastics, like Luxa. Reading.
              Running around in the woods with my friends.
            </p>

            <p>
              <span>Jen Rees:</span> Many people think bats, rats, cockroaches,
              and spiders are creepy! Did you have to get over your fear of any
              (or all!) of them to write this story?
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>Suzanne Collins:</span> I wish I could say that after I
              researched the creepy animals I was no longer at all afraid of
              them…but that would be a big fib!...
            </p>

            <p>
              <span>Jen Rees:</span> Are you kinder to cockroaches, bats, rats,
              and/or spiders nowadays?
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>Suzanne Collins:</span> I don't think I was ever
              particularly unkind to them…but I do have more of a connection
              with them now...
            </p>

            <p>
              <span>Jen Rees:</span> Did you have a sibling who, like Boots, got
              you into a world of trouble?
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>Suzanne Collins:</span> I have two older sisters and one
              older brother and hold them largely responsible for the trouble I
              got into growing up...
            </p>

            <p><span>Jen Rees:</span> Have you ever lived in New York City?</p>
            <p>
              <span>Suzanne Collins:</span> I lived in New York City for 16
              years, from 1987 to 2003...
            </p>

            <p>
              <span>Jen Rees:</span> If you had to go to the Underland, what
              items would you take along with you?
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>Suzanne Collins:</span> I'd take all the flashlights and
              batteries I could find...
            </p>

            <p><span>Jen Rees:</span> And who would you take with you?</p>
            <p>
              <span>Suzanne Collins:</span> My husband, Cap, would be great to
              have in the Underland...
            </p>

            <p>
              <span>Jen Rees:</span> Have you ever been lost and wanted to find
              your way home?
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>Suzanne Collins:</span> All the time. I have a terrible
              sense of direction...
            </p>

            <p>
              <span>Jen Rees:</span> Do you think you were destined to be a
              writer? (or is there some free will involved?!)
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>Suzanne Collins:</span> I…have no idea how to answer this...
            </p>

            <p>
              <span>Jen Rees:</span> If you could invite one of the characters
              to have dinner with your family, who would it be? What might you
              cook for them?! What questions would you ask them?
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>Suzanne Collins:</span> I would invite Ripred to dinner
              because I think he would tell the most interesting stories...
            </p>

            <p>
              <span>Jen Rees:</span> All fun aside for a moment, Gregor is also
              about war and battling forces and survival. Can you tell us a
              little bit about this?
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>Suzanne Collins:</span> Gregor falls into a fantastical
              world, but he's really acting out the main role in a war story...
