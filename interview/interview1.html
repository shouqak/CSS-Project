            <p>On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the publication of The Hunger Games, author Suzanne Collins and publisher David Levithan discussed the evolution of the story, the editorial process, and the first ten years of the life of the trilogy, encompassing both books and films. The following is their written conversation.</p>
            <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The following interview contains a discussion of all three books in The Hunger Games Trilogy, so if you have yet to read Catching Fire and Mockingjay, you may want to read them before reading the full interview.</p>

            <p><span>David Levithan:</span> Let's start at the origin moment for The Hunger Games. You were flipping channels one night...</p>
            <p><span>Suzanne Collins:</span> Yes, I was flipping through the channels one night between reality television programs and actual footage of the Iraq War, when the idea came to me. At the time, I was completing the fifth book in The Underland Chronicles and my brain was shifting to whatever the next project would be...</p>

            <p><span>David Levithan:</span> Can you tell me what you mean by "just war theory" and how that applies to the setup of the trilogy?</p>
            <p><span>Suzanne Collins:</span> Just war theory has evolved over thousands of years in an attempt to define what circumstances give you the moral right to wage war and what is acceptable behavior within that war and its aftermath...</p>

            <p><span>David Levithan:</span> As with most novelists I know, once you have that origin moment – usually a connection of two elements (in this case, war and entertainment) – the number of connections quickly increases, as different elements of the story take their place. I know another connection you made early on was with mythology, particularly the myth of Theseus. How did that piece come to fit?</p>
            <p><span>Suzanne Collins:</span> I was such a huge Greek mythology geek as a kid, it's impossible for it not to come into play in my storytelling...</p>

            <p><span>David Levithan:</span> But in this case, you dispensed with the Minotaur, no? Instead, the arena harkens more to gladiator vs. gladiator than to gladiator vs. bull. What influenced this construction?</p>
            <p><span>Suzanne Collins:</span> A fascination with the gladiator movies of my childhood, particularly Spartacus. Whenever it ran, I'd be glued to the set...</p>

            <p><span>David Levithan:</span> Can you talk about how war stories influenced you as a young reader, and then later as a writer? How did this knowledge of war stories affect your approach to writing The Hunger Games?</p>
            <p><span>Suzanne Collins:</span> Now you can find many wonderful books written for young audiences that deal with war. That wasn't the case when I was growing up...</p>

            <p><span>David Levithan:</span> Another key piece of The Hunger Games is the voice and perspective that Katniss brings to it. I know some novelists start with a character and then find a story through that character, but with The Hunger Games (and correct me if I'm wrong) I believe you had the idea for the story first, and then Katniss stepped into it. Where did she come from? I'd love for you to talk about the origin of her name, and also the origin of her very distinctive voice.</p>
            <p><span>Suzanne Collins:</span> Katniss appeared almost immediately after I had the idea, standing by the bed with that bow and arrow...</p>

            <p><span>David Levithan:</span> I am now trying to summon an alternate universe where the Mockingjay is named Swamp Potato Everdeen. Seems like a PR challenge. But let's stay for a second on the voice – because it's not a straightforward, generic American voice. There's a regionalism to it, isn't there? Was that present from the start?</p>
            <p><span>Suzanne Collins:</span> It was. There's a slight District 12 regionalism to it, and some of the other tributes use phrases unique to their regions as well...</p>

            <p><span>David Levithan:</span> I'm curious about Katniss's family structure. Was it always as we see it, or did you ever consider giving her parents greater roles? How much do you think the Everdeen family's story sets the stage for Katniss's story within the trilogy?</p>
            <p><span>Suzanne Collins:</span> Her parents have their own histories in District 12 but I only included what's pertinent to Katniss's tale...</p>

            <p><span>David Levithan:</span> This completely fascinates me because I, as an author, rarely know more (consciously) about the characters than what's in the story. But this sounds like you know much more about the Everdeen parents than found their way to the page. What are some of the more interesting things about them that a reader wouldn't necessarily know?</p>
            <p><span>Suzanne Collins:</span> Your way sounds a lot more efficient. I have a world of information about the characters that didn't make it into the book...</p>

            <p><span>David Levithan:</span> I have to ask – did you know from the start how Prim's story was going to end? (I can't imagine writing the reaping scene while knowing – but at the same time I can't imagine writing it without knowing.)</p>
            <p><span>Suzanne Collins:</span> You almost have to know it and not know it at the same time to write it convincingly, because the dramatic question, Can Katniss save Prim?, is introduced in the first chapter of the first book, and not answered until almost the end of the trilogy...</p>

            <p><span>David Levithan:</span> If Katniss was the first character to make herself known within story, when did Peeta and Gale come into the equation? Did you know from the beginning how their stories would play out vis-à-vis Katniss's?</p>
            <p><span>Suzanne Collins:</span> Peeta and Gale appeared quickly, less as two points on a love triangle, more as two perspectives in the just war debate...</p>

            <p><span>David Levithan:</span> And did you always know which worldview would win? It's interesting to see it presented in such a clear-cut way, because when I think of Katniss, I certainly think of force over diplomacy.</p>
            <p><span>Suzanne Collins:</span> And yet Katniss isn't someone eager to engage in violence and she takes no pleasure in it...</p>

            <p><span>David Levithan:</span> Where does Haymitch fit into this examination of war? What worldview does he bring?</p>
            <p><span>Suzanne Collins:</span> Haymitch was badly damaged in his own war, the second Quarter Quell, in which he witnessed and participated in terrible things in order to survive and then saw his loved ones killed for his strategy...</p>

            <p><span>David Levithan:</span> I'm also curious about how you balanced the personal and political in drawing the relationship between Katniss and Gale. They have such a history together – and I think you powerfully show the conflict that arises when you love someone, but don't love what they believe in.</p>
            <p><span>Suzanne Collins:</span> Yes, I think it's painful, especially because they feel so in tune in so many ways...</p>

            <p><span>David Levithan:</span> In drawing Gale's and Peeta's roles in the story, how conscious were you of the gender inversion from traditional narrative tropes?</p>
            <p><span>Suzanne Collins:</span> It came naturally because, while Gale and Peeta are very important characters, it's Katniss's story...</</p>

            <p><span>David Levithan:</span> For Peeta... why baking?</p>
            <p><span>Suzanne Collins:</span> Bread crops up a lot in The Hunger Games. It's the main food source in the districts, as it was for many people historically...</p>

            <p><span>David Levithan:</span> Speaking of Plutarch – in a meta way, the two of you share a job (although when you do it, only fictional people die). When you were designing the arena for the first book, what influences came into play?</p>
            <p><span>Suzanne Collins:</span> Katniss has a lot going against her in the first arena—she's inexperienced, smaller than a lot of her competitors, and hasn't the training of the Careers—so the arena needed to be in her favor...</p>

            <p><span>David Levithan:</span> So where does Plutarch fall into the just war spectrum? There are many layers to his involvement in what's going on.</p>
            <p><span>Suzanne Collins:</span> Plutarch is the namesake of the biographer Plutarch, and he's one of the few characters who has a sense of the arc of history...</p>

            <p><span>David Levithan:</span> When it comes to larger world building, how much did you know about Panem before you started writing?</p>
            <p><span>Suzanne Collins:</span> Before I started writing I knew there were thirteen districts—that's a nod to the thirteen colonies—and that they'd each be known for a specific industry...</</p>

            <p><span>David Levithan:</span> How do you think being from District 12 defines Katniss, Peeta, and Gale? Could they have been from any other district, or is their residency in 12 formative for the parts of their personalities that drive the story?</p>
            <p><span>Suzanne Collins:</span> Very formative. District 12 is the joke district, small and poor, rarely producing a victor in the Hunger Games...</p>

            <p><span>David Levithan:</span> Let's talk about the Capitol for a moment—particularly its most powerful resident. I know that every name you give a character is deliberate, so why President Snow?</p>
            <p><span>Suzanne Collins:</span> Snow because of its coldness and purity. That's purity of thought, although most people would consider it pure evil...</</p>

            <p><span>David Levithan:</span> The bond between Katniss and Snow is one of the most interesting in the entire series. Because even when they are in opposition, there seems to be an understanding between them that few if any of the other characters in the trilogy share.</p>
            <p><span>Suzanne Collins:</span> On the surface, she's the face of the rebels, he's the face of the Capitol. Underneath, things are a lot more complicated...</</p>

            <p><span>David Levithan:</span> One of the things that both Snow and Katniss realize is the power of media and imagery on the population. Snow may appear heartless to some, but he is very attuned to the "hearts and minds" of his citizens.</p>
            <p><span>Suzanne Collins:</span> Propaganda decides the outcome of the war. This is why Plutarch implements the airtime assault; he understands that whoever controls the airwaves controls the power...</</p>

            <p><span>David Levithan:</span> In terms of the revolution, appearance matters—and two of the characters who seem to understand this the most are Cinna and Caesar Flickerman, one in a principled way, one... not as principled.</p>
            <p><span>Suzanne Collins:</span> That's exactly right. Cinna uses his artistic gifts to woo the crowd with spectacle and beauty...</</p>

            <p><span>David Levithan:</span> As a writer, you studiously avoided the trope of harkening back to the "old" geography—i.e., there isn't a character who says, "This was once a land known as... Delaware." Why did you decide to avoid pinning down Panem to our contemporary geography?</p>
            <p><span>Suzanne Collins:</span> The geography has changed because of natural and man-made disasters, so it's not as simple as overlaying a current map on Panem...</</p>

            <p><span>David Levithan:</span> Let's talk about the D word. When you sat down to write The Hunger Games, did you think of it as a dystopian novel?</p>
            <p><span>Suzanne Collins:</span> I thought of it as a war story. I love dystopia, but it will always be secondary to that...</</p>

            <p><span>David Levithan:</span> What do you think it was about the world into which the book was published that made it viewed so prominently as a dystopia?</p>
            <p><span>Suzanne Collins:</span> In the same way most people would define The Underland Chronicles as a fantasy series, they would define The Hunger Games as a dystopian trilogy, and they'd be right...</</p>

            <p><span>David Levithan:</span> What was the relationship between current events and the world you were drawing?</p>
            <p><span>Suzanne Collins:</span> I would say the latter. Some authors—okay, you for instance—can digest events quickly and channel them into their writing...</</p>

            <p><span>David Levithan:</span> There's nothing I like more than talking to writers about writing—so I'd love to ask about your process.</p>
            <p><span>Suzanne Collins:</span> Structure's one of my favorite parts of writing. I always work a story out with Post-its, sometimes using different colors for different character arcs...</</p>

            <p><span>David Levithan:</span> Would you deliberately plant things in book one to bloom in books two or three?</p>
            <p><span>Suzanne Collins:</span> Oh, yes, I definitely planted things. For instance, Johanna Mason is mentioned in the third chapter of the first book although she won't appear until Catching Fire...</</p>

            <p><span>David Levithan:</span> Since much of your early experience as a writer was as a playwright, I'm curious: What did you learn as a playwright that helped you as a novelist?</p>
            <p><span>Suzanne Collins:</span> I studied theatre for many years—first acting, then playwriting—and I have a particular love for classical theatre...</</p>

            <p><span>David Levithan:</span> Where do you write? Are you a longhand writer or a laptop writer? Do you listen to music as you write, or go for the monastic, writerly silence?</p>
            <p><span>Suzanne Collins:</span> I write best at home in a recliner. I used to write longhand, but now it's all laptop. Definitely not music, it demands to be listened to...</</p>

            <p><span>David Levithan:</span> You talked earlier about researching survival training and edible plants for these books. What other research did you have to do?</p>
            <p><span>Suzanne Collins:</span> You know, I'm just not very handy. I read a lot about how to build a bow from scratch, but I doubt I could ever make one...</</p>

            <p><span>David Levithan:</span> While I wish I could say the editorial team (Kate Egan, Jennifer Rees, and myself) were the first ever readers of The Hunger Games, I know this isn't true. When you're writing a book, who reads it first?</p>
            <p><span>Suzanne Collins:</span> My husband, Cap, and my literary agent, Rosemary Stimola, have consistently been the books' first readers...</</p>

            <p><span>David Levithan:</span> Looking back now at the editorial conversations we had about The Hunger Games—which were primarily with Kate, as me and Jen rode shotgun—can you recall any significant shifts or discussions?</p>
            <p><span>Suzanne Collins:</span> What I mostly recall is how relieved I was to know that I had such amazing people to work with on the book before it entered the world...</</p>

            <p><span>David Levithan:</span> And then there was the question of the title...</p>
            <p><span>Suzanne Collins:</span> Okay, this I remember clearly. The original title of the first book was The Tribute of District Twelve. You wanted to change it to The Hunger Games, which was my name for the series...</</p>

            <p><span>David Levithan:</span> With The Hunger Games, the choice of Games is natural—but the choice of Hunger is much more odd and interesting. So I'll ask: Why Hunger Games?</p>
            <p><span>Suzanne Collins:</span> Because food is a lethal weapon. Withholding food, that is...</</p>

            <p><span>David Levithan:</span> The cover was another huge effort. We easily had over a hundred different covers comped up before we landed on the iconic one.</p>
            <p><span>Suzanne Collins:</span> Oh, it's a brilliant cover, which I should point out I had nothing to do with...</</p>

            <p><span>David Levithan:</span> Obviously, the four movies had an enormous impact on how widely the story spread across the globe. The whole movie process started with the producers coming on board. What made you know they were the right people to shepherd this story into another form?</p>
            <p><span>Suzanne Collins:</span> When I decided to sell the entertainment rights to the book, I had phone interviews with over a dozen producers...</</p>

            <p><span>David Levithan:</span> You cowrote the screenplay for the first Hunger Games movie. I know it's an enormously tricky thing for an author to adapt their own work. How did you approach it?</p>
            <p><span>Suzanne Collins:</span> I wrote the initial treatments and first draft and then Billy Ray came on for several drafts and then our director, Gary Ross, developed it into his shooting script...</</p>

            <p><span>David Levithan:</span> One of the strange things for me about having a novel adapted is knowing that the actors involved will become, in many people's minds, the faces and bodies of the characters who have heretofore lived as bodiless voices in my head.</p>
            <p><span>Suzanne Collins:</span> I definitely do picture the characters when I'm writing them. The actress who looks exactly like my book Katniss doesn't exist...</</p>

            <p><span>David Levithan:</span> All of the actors did such a fantastic job with your characters (truly). Are there any in particular that have stayed with you?</p>
            <p><span>Suzanne Collins:</span> A writer friend of mine once said, "Your cast—they're like a basket of diamonds." That's how I think of them...</</p>

            <p><span>David Levithan:</span> We're talking on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of The Hunger Games. Looking back at the past ten years, what have some of the highlights been?</p>
            <p><span>Suzanne Collins:</span> The response from the readers, especially the young audience for which it was written...</</p>

            <p><span>David Levithan:</span> The Hunger Games Trilogy has been an international bestseller. Why do you think this series struck such an important chord throughout the world?</p>
            <p><span>Suzanne Collins:</span> Possibly because the themes are universal. War is a magnet for difficult issues...</</p>

            <p><span>David Levithan:</span> As we celebrate the past ten years and look forward to many decades to come for this trilogy, I'd love for us to end where we should—with the millions of readers who've embraced these books. What words would you like to leave them with?</p>
            <p><span>Suzanne Collins:</span> Thank you for joining Katniss on her journey. And may the odds be ever in your favor.</p>
