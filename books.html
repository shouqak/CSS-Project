            As the day dawns on the fiftieth annual Hunger Games, fear grips the
            districts of Panem. This year, in honor of the Quarter Quell, twice
            as many tributes will be taken from their homes. Back in District
            12, Haymitch Abernathy is trying not to think too hard about his
            chances. All he cares about is making it through the day and being
            with the girl he loves.
